- The real-time retail model that Shein pioneered cuts the time from design to production from three weeks to as little as _three days_ (although typical times are 5-7 days).
	- Shein cuts out any of the remaining middlemen, and has built an advanced cross-border version of the Consumer to Manufacturer (C2M) model that [[拼多多|PDD]] pioneered.
