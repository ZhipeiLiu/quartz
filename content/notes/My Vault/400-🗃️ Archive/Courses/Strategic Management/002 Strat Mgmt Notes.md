[[20200905 The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy]]

Industry Analysis in Practice
- Must look over a full market cycle to avoid short-term bumps/ anomalies
- Key is to understand the underpinning of competition and the root cause of profitability (quantifiable)
- The strength of the competitive forces affects prices, costs, and the investment required to compete (it is directly linked to the income statements and balance sheets)
- Not just pluses and minuses, but shows an industry in its overall terms

Force | Key Points | Strategies to Manage
------------ | ------------ | ------------
Suppliers | More concentrated and/or more specialized, greater risk | Use many suppliers, standardize specs/ requirements when possible. Verical integration
New Entrants | Low barriers to entry/high ROIC, greater risk | Leverage economies of scope, legal/patent, R&D, distribution/shelf space/location/access, increase switching costs (contracts/loyalty rewards/app), brand, complementary products
Substitutes | Many available substitutes give power to buyers, increase pressure | Same strategies as new entrants PLUS acquisitions
Buyers | Highly concentrated buyers OR low switching costs empower buyers | Diversify type of buyers, increase switching costs, increase depth of relationship (loyalty/frequency rewards), brand, network effects/ complementary products/ eco system
Rivals | Fast growing industries with "room for all" puts less pressure. Slow/low growth OR many rivals competing equally increases pressure | Intense rivalry can demand more dollars spent for R&D, marketing, sales hiring, capital/equipment, geographic expansion, M&A
