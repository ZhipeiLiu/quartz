#### Topics/Key Concepts/Questions: 
1. Standardizing financial statements
2. Common financial ratios used for ratio analysis
3. The DuPont Identity
4. Problems with financial statement analysis

#### Consider the following questions as you review the learning resources this week:
- How do standardized financial statements facilitate meaningful comparisons across firms or through time? 
- What does the value of each financial ratio reveal about the firm? Is the company better off when the ratio is high or low?
- What incremental information can be gained by applying the DuPont Identity to a firm’s return on equity (ROE)? 

Notes:
###### Standardizing FInancial Statements
Three statements:
- Balance Sheet
- Income Statement
- CF
1. $$Common-Size\ Inventory = \frac{Inventory}{( Total\ current\ asset + Net\ fixed\ asset )}$$
2. $$Common-Size\ EBIT = \frac{( Sales - COGS - Depreciation )}{Sales}$$
##### Ratio Analysis Using Short-Term Solvency Measures
Why ratios:
- time trend analysis
- peer group analysis

Categories:
1. short term solvency (liquidity)
	- assess ability to fulfill its short term financial obligations without undue stress
	- focus on current assets and current liabilities
	- $$NWC = Current\ assets - Current\ liabilities$$
	- $$Current\ ratio = \frac{Current\ assets}{Current\ liabilities}$$
	- $$Quick\ ratio = \frac{Current\ assets - Inventory}{Current\ liabilities}$$
	- $$Cash\ ratio = \frac{Cash}{Current\ liabilities}$$
2. long term solvency (financial leverage)
	- evaluate long-run ability to fulfill its financial obligations
	- $$Total\ debt\ ratio = \frac{Total\ assets - Total\ equity}{Total\ assets}$$
		- Variation 1: $$Debt-Equity\ ratio = \frac{Total\ debt}{Total\ equity}$$
		- Variation 2: $$Equity\ multiplier = \frac{Total\ assets}{Total\ equity}$$
	- $$Equity\ multiplier = 1 + D/E\ ratio$$
	- $$Times\ interest\ earned\ ratio\ (TIE) = \frac{EBIT}{Interest} $$
		- AKA Interest coverage ratio
		- Problem: EBIT is derived after netting out depreciation and ammortization, which are non-cash expenses 
			- so if we want to measure cash availability, we will have to add back those - they were not cash-based expenses at the first place
		- Enters Cash coverage ratio
	- $$Cash\ coverage\ ratio = \frac{EBITDA}{Interest}$$
	- $$Debt-EBITDA\ ratio = \frac{Interest-bearing\ debt}{EBITDA}$$
		- $$I-BD = NP + LT\ Debt$$
		- lower value indicates lower amounts of debt relative to the cash available to finance that obligation - weak sign of financial distress
3. asset management (turnover)
	 - reveal how efficiently a firm uses its assets
	 - AKA efficiency ratios or utilization ratios
	 - $$Inventory\ turnover = \frac{COGS}{Inventory}$$ 
		 - ---- in unit years
	 - $$Days'\ sales\ in\ inventory = \frac{365}{Inventory\ turnover}$$ 
		 -  ---- in unit days
	 - $$Receivables\ turnover = \frac{Sales}{AR} $$
	 - $$Days'\ sales\ in\ receivables = \frac{365}{Receivables\ turnover}$$
		 - AKA average colelction period (ACP)
	 - $$Total\ asset\ turnover = \frac{Sales}{Total\ assets}$$
4. profitability
	- capture how efficiently a firm manages its operations and how this translates to the bottom line
	- vary across industries; make comparisons within the same industry or the same company chronically 
	- $$Profit\ margin = \frac{Net\ income}{Sales}$$
	- $$EBITDA\ margin = \frac{EBITDA}{Sales}$$
		- **Why EBITDA** - commonly used as a proxy for before-tax operating cash flows; thus not affected by interest expense (related to financing decisions), taxes (controled by administrations), D&A (affected by accounting decisions)
	- $$ROA = \frac{Net\ income}{Total\ assets}$$
	- $$ROE = \frac{Net\ income}{Total\ equity}$$
		- Final goal of financial management is to maximize shareholders' wealth
5. market value
	- consider the value of a firm's stock based on the market price per share
	- $$EPS = \frac{Net\ income}{Shares\ outstanding}$$
	- $$P/E\ ratio = \frac{Price\ per\ share}{Earnings\ per\ share}$$
	- $$Market-to-book\ ratio = \frac{Market\ value\ per\ share}{Book\ value\ per\ share}$$
		- considered historic cost; ratio greater than1 --> the firm is creating value
	- $$Market\ capitalization = \frac{Price\ per\ share}{Shares\ outstanding}$$
	- $$Enterprise\ value\ (EV) = Market\ Cap + Market\ value\ of\ interest-bearing\ debt - Cash$$
		- used when a firm wants to acquire another firm
		- reveals how much $ is needed to purchase all outstanding shares of a firm along with paying off all their debts; their cash can also be used to pay down debt immediately so you subtract cash
		- it is sometimes difficult to obtain market value of interest-bearing debt, so we instead use the book value
	- $$EV multiple = \frac{EV}{EBITDA}$$
		- to compare across different firms of different sizes
		- higher value --> greater growth opportunities
##### The DuPont Identity
PuPont identity - decomposing ROE to better understand its fundamental determinants
$$ROE = \frac{Net\ income}{Total\ equity} = \frac{Net\ income}{Assets} \times \frac{Assets}{Total\ equity} = \frac{Net\ income}{Total\ equity} \times \frac{Sales}{Assets} \times \frac{Assets}{Equity}$$
$$ = ROA \times Equity\ multiplier = ROA \times (1 + Debt-Equity\ ratio)$$
$$ = \frac{Profit\ Margin * Sales}{Total\ equity}$$

##### Problems with Financial Statement Analysis
1. The process lacks guidance from udnerlying theory
	- Which ratios are most revelant
	- What is a typical value for each
2. Benchmarking is difficult for diversified firms
3. Peer group analysis is complicated 
	- Financial Accounting - accounting procedures
	- Methods of operation
	- Regulatory environments
	- Fiscal years
	- Extraordinary events

#### Guiding Questions
Consider the following questions as you review the learning resources this week:
- How do standardized financial statements facilitate meaningful comparisons across firms or through time? 
- What does the value of each financial ratio reveal about the firm? Is the company better off when the ratio is high or low?
- What incremental information can be gained by applying the DuPont Identity to a firm’s return on equity (ROE)?
