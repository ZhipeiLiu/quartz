- The transitions of many products from a centralized architecture where one firm supplies the complete solution into a modular architecture where specialists focus on specific vertical slices of the value network can have interesting consequences.
- To become large and successful, the platform owners need the complementary pieces to have the motivation, economic or otherwise, to grow in concert.
- Terms like “increasing returns to scale” and “network effects” are frequently used to justify big up-front investments to build out infrastructure well in advance of revenues.


- Scale Economies
	- Economies of scale are cost decreases that result from expanding production.
		- cost per unit of output rises more slowly than the costs of inputs in the same proportions
		- Economies of scale are frequently found in industries that require large capital expenditures on plant and equipment, or the establishment of a large infrastructure prior to the ability to begin providing service.
			- a low or no fixed cost, but the marginal cost of production declines with increasing volumes. bulk buying 
		- The other risk with “get big fast” is that large scale operations are vulnerable to capacity underutilization.

- Direct and Indirect Network Effects
	- While scale effects operate primarily on the cost side, network effects operate on the “willingness to pay” side. The former is mostly inside the boundaries of what the firm controls, the latter are described as externalities.
	- a shift from vertically integrated towards modular
		- industry structures often shift as well to favor firms who specialize in platforms,
		- the associated firms who produce complements
	- challenge for the manager is to coordinate complementing products provided by the value network. two generic types of coordination that are valuable to system builders
		- the consumer connects the product to a network as part of its usage model
			- the increase in value of belonging to a network that is a consequence of other users joining and enlarging the network – is called a network effect.
		- consumers must choose a durable hardware platform
			- Systems that are expected to be popular will be perceived to have more widely available or less expensive components, and for those very reasons will become more popular. This is known as an indirect network effect.
			- Indirect network effects arise in systems where there are economies of specialization in “horizontal layers” of a system (e.g. operating system for PCs), made possible by technology advances and modularization, and when consumer demand for variety favors competition based on flexibility and configurability.
	- Many product companies aspire to this kind of “consumables” business model because of the economic similarity to monopoly pricing. Economists describe companies in this set of circumstances as an “integrated monopolist.”

- Multi-sided Platforms
	- operate as market intermediaries who reduce search or transaction costs
	- The business model of a multi-sided platform is a combination of pricing and strategic decisions that affect each side
	- issues to address:
		- The order to get the sides on board / chicken-and-egg problem
		- platform design
		- Governance
		- Pricing structure


- Scaling the business model
	- Economies of scale operate on the cost side and are inherently limited in their ability to create value (cost cannot go below zero, after all).  Network effects operate on the willingness to pay side and don’t necessarily have an upper bound.
