- Steps:
	1. Catalog activities (value chain)
	2. Analyze drivers of relative costs
	3. Analyze drivers to increase willingness to pay
	4. Explore how companies make evaluate options and make choice

- Catalog Activities - template to overlay companies to study differences in activities
	==#midtermreview *do a activity analysis for 1 company OR company two companies*==
	- do not list every activity
	- fill in relevant and different activities that are drivers for cost and willingness to pay 
	- primary/decision activities from below drive support activities from above
- Understanding the drivers of cost - understand ***relative*** factors on cost between competitors
	- e.g.
		- location (urban v/ rural)
		- local market-share
		- broad product v/ narrow
		- nature of product (freshness)
	- goals
		- pick up major differences across competitors or strategic options
		- correspond to technically separable activities
		- are large enough to influence the overall cost 
- ==Activities and willingness to pay==
	- Influence factors:
		- quality
		- performance
		- features
		- aesthetics
		- durability
	- at point of sale
		- ease of purchase
		- speed of delivery
		- quality of support/advice at POS
	- post sale
		- service (warranties, repair services)
		- complementary products (ecosystem)
	- How to determine WTP
		- know who the actual buyer is
		- understand what the buyer wants (and what they are willing to pay for)
		- assess how successful each player in the market is at fulfilling the buyer's needs
			- what do customers want
			- how did each company's strategic choice of activities impact the customer's perceptions?
		- Horizontal versus vertical differentiation
		- Segmentation versus mass customization

4. Explore options, make choices
	- A creative, iterative process. Bottom line - Look at the value chain and eliminate activities that generate costs without creating a willingness to pay
		- Change scope (range of customers) - deeper service to a smaller segment OR specialized service(s) to a broad segment
		- Review value-chain for suppliers and buyers as well (think more broadly)
		- Improve quality enough to justify costs
		- Assess how action/activity will impact the competition (price wars, excess supply, stronger competitors retaliate)
		- How does activity broaden scope (more targets)

### Class summary - Creating competitive advantage
1. Evaluate profits across and within industries to fully understand adding value/creating a competitive advantage
2. The ability to generate and capture profits in an industry derives from add value. A firm adds value when an industry is better off with the firm is in it than without it
3. A firm can't claim any value unless it adds value
4. To add value, a firm must drive a wedge between a customer's willingness to pay and supplier opportunity cost. A firm that drives a **wider wedge is said to have obtained competitive advantage**
5. To establish competitive advantage, a firm has to do different things than its rivals on a day to day basis. These differences in activities and their effects on relative costs and relative willingness to pay can be analyzed in detail

- Does Edge still matter?
	- Different customers have different needs/interest in faster response time
	- Tough to quantify the effect of the architecture (how do you know what contributed to the response time)
	- Disagreement on how technology and demand would evolve
	- Cost v/s benefit
		- Had to negotiate with a number of scattered ISPs for space
		- Higher costs to support more servers
		- BUT the software Akamai needed to create to manage servers provided unique / valuable advantages



### Introduction
- Rivalry in pharmaceuticals is muted by factors such as patent protection, product differentiation, and expanding demand
- The concept of competitive advantage helps strategists understand and analyze **within** industry differences in performance. 
	- ==A firm has a competitive advantage over its rivals if it has driven a wide wedge between the amount its customers are willing to pay and the costs it incurs==—indeed, a wider wedge than its competitors have achieved.
- Indeed, ==industry analysis is crucial to creating competitive advantage for several reasons==
	- companies that generate competitive advantages typically do so by devising strategies that neutralize the unattractive features of their industries and exploit the attractive features
	- industry conditions appear to have a large influence on whether competitive advantages are even possible
	- market leaders often face a tension between managing industry- structure and pursuing an advantage within that structure.
- ==How firms create competitive advantage?==
	- configure itself to do something unique and valuable - irreplaceable
	- competitive advantage arises only when the full range of a firm's activities—production, finance, marketing, logistics, and so on—act in harmony.
	- competitive advantage is associated with creating a large gap between a customer’s willingness to pay and the company’s cost
	- A firm's added value plays a large role in determining how much value it actually captures in a transaction
	- The notion of added value highlights the fact that **competitive advantage derives fundamentally from *scarcity***
- two basic ways a firm can establish an advantage.
	- raise customers' willingness to pay for its products without incurring a commensurate increase in supplier opportunity cost
	- reduce supplier opportunity cost without sacrificing willingness to pay.
		- competitive advantage can come from better management of supplier relations
- a firm can achieve a competitive advantage by devising a way to 
	1. raise willingness to pay a great deal with only slight increases in costs (differentiation strategy)
	2. reap large cost savings with only slight decreases in customer willingness to pay (low-cost strategy)
- differentiated
	- it has boosted the willingness of customers to pay for its output - that it commands a price premium
	- do not mean simply that the company is different from its competitors.
	- a company does not differentiate itself by charging a lower price than its rivals.
- produce superior products at lower cost and thus achieve a dual competitive advantage
- By analyzing a firm activity by activity, managers can
	1. understand why the firm does or does not have a competitive advantage
	2. spot opportunities to increase a firm ’s competitive advantage
	3. foresee shifts in competitive advantage
- analyze activities in four steps.
	1. catalog the firm’s activities
		-  value chain illustrates the sequence of activities or discrete economic functions a company performs to design, produce, sell, deliver, and support its products
	2. examine the costs associated with each activity, and they explore differences in rivals' activities to understand how and why their own costs are higher or lower
		- determine the cost drivers
		- Cost drivers are critical because they allow managers to estimate competitors' cost positions
		- Using their own company's costs and the numerical relationships to cost drivers, managers can estimate a competitor's cost position
			- important to focus on differences in individual activities, not just differences in total cost
			- Good cost analyses typically focus on a subset of a firm's activities
			- For activities that account for a thicker slice of costs, it's important to look closely at cost drivers
			- A particular cost driver should be included only if it is likely to vary across the competitors under consideration
			- because the analysis of relative costs inevitably involves a large number of assumptions, sensitivity analysis is crucial
	3. analyze how each activity generates customer willingness to pay, and they study differences in competitors‘ activities to examine how and why their customers are willing to pay more or less
		- This type of disparity, in which customers rank products differently, is known as horizontal differentiation
		- Vertical differentiation arises when customers agree on which product is better
		- mass customization
	4. consider changes in the firm's activities that could widen the wedge between costs and willingness to pay
		- identify each competitor's essential driver.
			- The process of distilling drivers often suggests new ways to achieve competitive advantage
		- When considering changes in activities, it is crucial to anticipate competitors’reactions.
		- In crafting alternatives, managers tend to focus too much on physical product characteristics and too little on benefits to buyers. 
			- Rarely do they fully consider how their activities can create a wedge between willingness to pay and costs. 
		- In rapidly changing markets, it is often valuable to pay special attention to "bleeding edge”customers—exacting buyers whose demands presage the needs of the larger marketplace. 
		- Undeserved customer segments often point the way to creative alternatives. 
		- One of the most potent ways a firm can widen the gap between willingness to pay and costs is to adjust the scope of its operations—that is, change the range of customers it serves or products it offers
		- In practice, it is often efficient and effective to reverse this process—to start with a set of options, articulate what each implies for activities, and then analyze the impact of each configuration of activities on the wedge between cost and willingness to pay
