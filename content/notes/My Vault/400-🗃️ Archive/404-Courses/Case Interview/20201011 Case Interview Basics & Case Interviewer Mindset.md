## Case Interview Basics & Case Interviewer Mindset

- Two categories of cases
	- Business Situation
	- Estimation Question

#### Interviewer mindset
- predictable - understand how the firm thinks 
- On the job in general	
	- Independence
	- 80/20 vs. Boil the Ocean
	- Precise vs/ "Good Enough" (Tolerance for ambiguity) + Role of Estimation
- Three rules of a consultant
	1. Often right, but never without data driven justification  
	2. It's not about being right, it is about being right in a client-friendly way
		- How you are right matters
		- Things that are **NOT** client friendly
			- Making conclusion without showing your work
			- Scattered brained
			- Can't be explained visually
			- Can't be justified with facts and data
			- Logically correct but not practical
	3. Don't be an asshole
- Interview mode
	1. Process excellence vs. specific answer
		- Repeatable vs. Got Lucky
	2. Logical, data-driven analysis
	3. Synthesis (the big picture) & presentation of conclusions
