- broadest sense, AI refers to machines that can learn, reason, and act for themselves.
- make their own decisions when faced with new situations
- Deep learning is a subset of ML
- breakthroughs, including facial recognition, hyper-realistic photo and voice synthesis, and AlphaGo
- grand idea: “artificial general intelligence,” or “AGI.”
- AI is also aspirational, and its definition is constantly evolving
- What is AI? - a flowchart

## [[What is machine learning?]]
source: MIT Review - Karen Hao

- Machine-learning algorithms are responsible for the vast majority of the
artificial intelligence advancements and applications
- Machine learning is the process that powers many of the services
	- recommendation systems
	- search engines
	- social-media feeds 
	- voice assistants 
- Deep learning is machine learning on steroids: it uses a technique that gives machines an enhanced ability to find—and amplify—even the smallest patterns.
	- deep neural network—deep because it has many, many layers of simple computational nodes that work together to munch through data and deliver a final result in the form of the prediction.
- supervised learning
	- machine (and deep) learning comes in three flavors: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement. In supervised learning, the most prevalent, the data is labeled to tell the machine exactly what patterns it should look for.
	- Netflix
- unsupervised learning
	- he data has no labels. The machine just looks for whatever patterns it can find. 
	- Unsupervised techniques aren’t as popular because they have less obvious applications. Interestingly, they have gained traction in cybersecurity.
- reinforcement learning
	- latest frontier of machine learning
	-  learns by trial and error to achieve a clear objective. It tries out lots of different things and is rewarded or penalized depending on whether its behaviors help or hinder it from reaching its objective.
