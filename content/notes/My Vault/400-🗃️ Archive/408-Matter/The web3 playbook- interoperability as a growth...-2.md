## Highlights
* In web2, applications completely control user data, so each application gets to decide unilaterally whether to interoperate with other applications.
* By a simple application of Metcalf’s Law, when two networks compete, the incentive for the smaller network is to want to interoperate, while the incentive for the larger network is to not want to interoperate.
* In web3, users own their data and therefore applications are unable to stop them from taking their data from one application to another.
* by simple application of Metcalf’s Law, the larger network has an incentive to block interoperability, but in web3 they can't do this.
* The key is that by ascribing value to the users' data and assets, you create an incentive for users to join and grow your network.
* a very nice property of web3: the incentives of the network/application are fully aligned with the incentives of the network participants (users, developers, creators, etc).
* Instead of hoping that application/network designers do the right thing (“don’t be evil”), web3 creates new systems where the rules are enforced by code (“can’t be evil”) and the incentives of the network and the network participants are fully aligned.
