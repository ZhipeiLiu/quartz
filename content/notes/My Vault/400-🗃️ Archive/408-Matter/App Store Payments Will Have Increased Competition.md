## Highlights
* “steering”, which is the practice of letting customers know about out-of-app options for transacting with them.
* Gacha games, and other games with virtual currency systems, are extraordinarily well-positioned to directly influence user payment behavior.
* Gacha games are named after the onomatopoeia describing vending machines in Japanese malls and arcades which dispense toys and trinkets for, typically, 100 to 200 yen (about $1-$2).
* it tends to naturally incentivize “whales” (high spenders) to go after the characters whom they most wish to play, and those whales can probabalistically spend surprisingly large amounts of money in small increments.
