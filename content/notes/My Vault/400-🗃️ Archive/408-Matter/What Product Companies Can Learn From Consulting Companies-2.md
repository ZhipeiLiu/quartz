## Highlights
* Consultancies are fundamentally repeatable processes which apply technical expertise to business problems.
* Positioning Your Product
* I'd pitch your software as solving identifiable business problems and generating the predictable increases-revenue-or-reduces-costs benefits that flow directly from them.
* Anchoring Value
* Consultants get very good at approximating the cost of in-house development / business / etc efforts.
* Products typically do not explicitly anchor themselves to employee costs. Instead, we often make the mistake of positioning ourselves vis-a-vis other products. We should anchor against employees instead,
* Promoting The Team As A Value-Add
* consultants demonstrate credibility and imply decreased project risk by:
* similar engagements
* unrelated accomplishments which demonstrate that the team is truthworthy
* references of past clients, because 3rd party confirmation is always stronger than 1st party
* consultant bios in proposals
* Product companies do an abysmally bad job at this.
* Pictures, by the way, are a major win.
* Keeping Yourself At Top Of Mind
* continuing to demonstrate value for the client,
* Actually call them and ask how they're doing:
* Send a weekly email report:
* Give them pretty deliverables:
* Give your good customers a reason to remember you:
* out
* Win business with the free phone call
* The agenda for the call was always the same: to convince the customer that there were things I could tell them that they didn't know, I would tell them things they didn't know, and continue doing so until I won the engagement. ("So I see you don't have annual billing on your pricing page. Do you offer annual billing? No? A lot of SaaS companies have found that that's a major win. Let me tell you a great way to implement it, you'll make 6 figures tomorrow...")
* win "the engagement" with a free consultation, deliver "the engagement" with your product.
* Free phone calls are another way to increase account LTV, by the way.
* Many of the customers with the highest perceived value from your offering make very modest use of your numerical quotas and/or features, and given no reason to step up to the higher plans, they might only pay you $50 a month even though they'd be happy to pay $1,000 if you gave them a reason to hang their hat on. The free phone consultation for people on the $1,000 plan is exactly such a reason.
* they can also build productized adjuncts to their consulting offerings which allow them more predictable/recurring revenue in addition to their traditional engagement pipeline.
