## Highlights
* Consultancies are fundamentally repeatable processes which apply technical expertise to business problems.
* Positioning Your Product
* I'd pitch your software as solving identifiable business problems and generating the predictable increases-revenue-or-reduces-costs benefits that flow directly from them.
* Anchoring Value
* Consultants get very good at approximating the cost of in-house development / business / etc efforts.
* Products typically do not explicitly anchor themselves to employee costs. Instead, we often make the mistake of positioning ourselves vis-a-vis other products. We should anchor against employees instead,
* Promoting The Team As A Value-Add
* consultants demonstrate credibility and imply decreased project risk by:
* similar engagements
* unrelated accomplishments which demonstrate that the team is truthworthy
* references of past clients, because 3rd party confirmation is always stronger than 1st party
* consultant bios in proposals
* Product companies do an abysmally bad job at this.
* Pictures, by the way, are a major win.
