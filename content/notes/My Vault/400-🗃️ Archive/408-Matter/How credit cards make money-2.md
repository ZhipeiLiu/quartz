## Highlights
* Credit cards make money through net interest, interchange, fees, and marketing contributions.
* Bundling and unbundling
* Credit cards are cross-subsidization engines, both within a particular card as used, within a portfolio of customers using a particular card, and across a financial institution’s customers.
* sometimes credit cards make money by losing money on the card itself.
  * **Note**: To subsidize other products of the bank
* Net interest
* It’s often forgotten, but prior to credit cards, many Main Street retailers like e.g. pharmacies maintained hundreds or thousands of credit accounts for customers individually, necessitating their own back offices, accounting, and collections headache. This was in the ultimate service of getting customers to choose them over competitors, transact in larger sizes, and come back more frequently, the “only three aims of marketing.”
* So credit cards generate loans. A lot of loans.
* Credit cards made the business of making loans work much better, by encouraging loans to be automated (rather than bespoke), by encouraging them to be more frequent, and by making them be iterative games rather than one-shots.
* The credit box, a metaphor from consumer underwriting, is conceptually a matrix which maps customer quality, loan amount, and similar to the prices you’d need to justify the underwriting decision or an outright denial, representing “This loan is negative expected value at all conceivable prices and we shouldn’t make it, at all.” Relaxing the box means approving more customers, approving smaller (less lucrative) and larger (riskier) loans, and giving borrowers better pricing.
* Interchange
* You’d sell a lot more coffee if you accepted our credit cards.
* You should pay us a bit for bringing you these desirable coffee drinkers,
* The lion’s share of interchange goes to the card issuer…
* Issuers have this argument for why they should get most of the fee: they do most of the work in the ecosystem.
* A much smaller portion of interchange goes to the credit card processor, to the acquiring bank, and to the credit card network.
* Interchange makes cards so valuable you’re paid to use them
* In the United States, issuers quickly discovered some customer archetypes which absolutely printed money via interchange.
  * **Note**: Business travelers who needed the cards to move money around
* they moved a lot of money, mostly between their employers and airlines/hotels.
* it sparked a change of practice across U.S. cards: competing aggressively for customers by rebating interchange in the form of either rewards (such as airline loyalty points) or cash back (a post-transaction discount).
* competition for desirable credit card users is so intense that profit margins for banks decline midway up the credit score ladder
* before recovering for the most desirable users
* Fees
* categorize them into account fees and usage-based fees,
* The two dominant types of credit card fees are over-the-limit fees and late payment fees.
* Both have declined as a percentage of the revenue mix over the last several years, due to consumers having better visibility into their usage (largely via mobile apps and IVR systems) and due to regulatory pressure to compress fee levels.
* The CARD Act alone probably returned over $10 billion a year to consumers.
* Marketing contributions
* there is a limit to business’ desire to pay for payment acceptance but a much higher willingness to pay for customer acquisition.
* These are sometimes paid for by the issuer as a marketing expense, but more frequently they’re the marketing spend of the boosted business.
  * **Note**: Credit card spend offers
* These are administered by a publicly traded company called Cardlytics, which charges the likes of Starbucks to drive them business, pays the consumer incentive out of the marketing spend, and also pays the bank for lending them the customer relationship.
* It is believed by many that banks make lots of money selling "your data." This is not a significant contributor to the economics of credit cards, for reasons which are slightly too complicated to get into in this piece. The short version: much like Google and Facebook, issuers can demonstrate to the most sophisticated organizations on the planet that they can deterministically influence actual purchasing behavior. That's easier to sell than a CSV file and worth more to more businesses.
