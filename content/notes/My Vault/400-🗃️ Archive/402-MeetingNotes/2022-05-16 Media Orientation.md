** Allocation, Activation, Attribution
### Allocation
*Insights to make the right channel & portfolio allocation decisions* 
#### Strategy
1. Maximize portfolio [[ROI]] by prioritizing [[scale brands]]
	1. 预算有限的情况下，优先满足scale brands（规模大的品牌）的推广需求
	2. ![](https://s1.vika.cn/space/2022/05/16/d76d3585c46c4929831e5ca2633481a0)
2. Lead with cross-platform video planning 
	1. VNP ([[Video Neutral Planning]]) - 十五秒视频作为统一介质，在不同平台做的综合的planning
		1. 因为15秒的Preroll和电视广告在ROI的表现consistently good
3. Focus support behind effective copy 
	1. Mars is a fact based planning system
	2. VNP copies should have [[AVI]] score or predicted AVI score above 3 stars
	3. Effective copy: 上线4-8周，predicted AVI score 三星及以上
4. **Invest with confidence in proven channels; focus test and learns on emerging areas to be proven:** 
	1. **Online video** (non-skippable) is the most consistently effective digital format - ROI
		1. 互联网视频的前贴片
	2. **Social/newsfeed** can be an effective digital format when **bespoke content** is used
		1. 新闻信息流
	3. **[[Short Video|Short format videos]] (6 sec)** drive efficiency but require **custom content** to prove effectiveness
		1. 开屏广告
	4. Skippable video currently is less effective than forced video options 
	5. Avoid traditional in-browser display where other alternatives exist
#### Overview
##### Investment Decisions for Growth
- The fragmentation of [[media]] consumption has created a tension between pursuing reach and advertising in channels that are difficult to assess for their sales impact. The optimal mix must reflect the local adoption of media channels and meet overall Reach targets. 
- Comms Key Beliefs outline the principles for portfolio and channel allocation between predictable and emerging/speculative channels, through a transparent assessment of risk and applied robust testing plans using signature Mars [[CMI]] methods.

### Activation
*Insights to help maximize impact while activating media & creative* 
1. Prioritize 1+ Reach against current and future category buyers 
	1. recruit new user + maintain old user
	2. 1+ Reach = 快消品、低价品：消费者至少看一次广告
	3. 汽车等高价值商品、做购买决定需要consideration的商品可能会考虑2/3/4+Reach
2. **More reach is better than less; any reach is better than none** 
3. **Enhance reach strategy via data and behavior-based audience buying** 
	1. Media transformation & digital buying empowered by data
	2. **behavior-based** audience buying
		1. For example:
			1. 过去三个月没有买过口香糖的
			2. 过去一年没有看过德芙广告
			3. 喝咖啡的人群（营造一个吃巧克力和咖啡做pairing的概念）
		2. however, behavior based data is limited in china due to regulation and awareness, therefore data size is limited
		3. versus alternatives:
			1. **demographic-based** 
			2. **interest-based**
4. Develop creative for digital and mobile behaviors - unadjusted TV copy is not effective in digital 
	1. TV copy is landscape, while mobile copy is portrait and has various shapes
5. **Success Factors** - Creative features that enhance chance of success:
	1. Effective copies must **grab attention from the start** (3-5s) or risk losing consumers altogether 
	2. **Integration of distinctive assets early** and often is linked to higher performing copy 
		1. help consumer identify brand early, so that even if audience lost focus in the ad, they recognize the brand and the reach is still somehow effective
	3. Ensure the creative story and executional elements are **single-minded and enable cognitive ease** 
		1. 故事越简单越好，越consistent越好，让大家理解起来不要费劲
	4. Increasing **positive emotions** over the course of an ad drives higher effectiveness
		1. 经验来讲，三星以上AVI score的copy都是打光比较亮、颜色鲜艳、音乐节奏明快，让广告显得正能量，观众看起来开心
### Attribution
*How we measure the success of our strategies*
1. Prioritize **reach and sales lift** to determine media success
	1. [[Kantar]]作为调研机构，做数据分析，根据4万个household panel，细致到by不同media channel或者copy对销售的贡献和影响，对未来campaign的优化和纠正
2. Use **behavioral best-in-class tools** to optimize creative content
	1. dynamic creative content etc.
	2. cooperate with local expertise and agencies to analyze user behavior to optimize customzied content for different groups of consumer
3. **Viewing Time** Matters : Optimize creative and media planning using time-in-view
	1. 让marketeer头痛
	2. 次数可以：秒针的监测代码放到投放代码里-以其被loading完的次数作为绩效考核的次数
	3. 完播率、时长能衡量内容、曝光有效性，但时长无法捕捉，或者观众在后台播放，有效观看时长/完播率在国内没有任何媒体和技术手段来监测，

## Q&A
### 很多广告形式的趋势变化（可跳过），品牌如何应对
- 库存越来越少，媒体用户超过三分之一的用户成为付费会员用户
- 方案
	- 做新型的创意中拆， 在内容做植入，无法被跳过触达付费用户
		- 植入成本较高，效果监测有延时
	- 转换战场和屏幕，OTV、MOT形式，手机投屏智能电视的程序化投放，专门针对VIP人群
		- 体量仍然在增长阶段
	- 补充VNP曝光量不足的情况
