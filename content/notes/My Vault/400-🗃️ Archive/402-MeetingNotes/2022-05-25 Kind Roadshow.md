### [[KIND]] Story
In 2004, our founder started KIND out of his desire to create a snack without compromise and a company where there's more to business than just profit. It was a humble start: a line of premium whole Fruit & Nut bars and a small team in NYC on a mission to inspire kindness, that sparked the creation of an entirely new category. 

With an entrepreneurial spirit, teamwork, grit and real purpose KIND began showing up in stores across the US. People started trying KIND experiencing their amazing taste, buying more and telling their friends. We were quickly becoming a cult favorite. And in 2008 when our field marketing efforts began, the growth of KIND became truly unstoppable. 

Today KIND has a family of snacks, each one promising to be healthy and tasty, wholesome and convenient and our KIND Movement has inspired millions of KIND acts bringing us one step closer to our goal of making kindness a state of mind.
