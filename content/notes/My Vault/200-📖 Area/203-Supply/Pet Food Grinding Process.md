#### Grinders
1. Currently 2 grinders 
2. A third grinder will be added as a part of the [[RSH Line 3|Line 3]] project scope

#### Scales
1. Inbound 2500kg SC I
2. Inbound 2500kg SC II
3. 2500 kg SC
4. 600 kg SC
5. 150 kg SC
6. 100 kg SC
7. 75 kg SC
8. 30 kg SC

#### Grinding Process Attributes
1. **Continuous** - always grinding
2. **Intermmitent** - 3 tons a batch
3. **Big first** - first dose [[RM]] that has the largest amount in the batch
4. **One at a time** - the grinder will not start grinding [[RM]] B until [[RM]] A is done
5. **Automated** by [[Courbon]]
	1. Deviation <5% to comply with [[Critical Control Point|CCP]]

#### Grinding Process Flow
1. Scale weighing 称量
2. Premixer 预混机 
	1. to stir the RMs for balanced distribution 搅拌均质
3. Grinder 粉碎机
	1. The quality output will be powerders with diameters < 0.7 mm
	2. It takes 10 min to grind 3 ton / 1 batch
	3. The process of grinding will generate a great amount of heat, therefore certain RMs that cannot stand heat will not be grinded and will be added to the next process
4. Hopper 暂存罐
	1. Addition of  [[Micronutrient]]
	2. Cannot overheat
5. Mixer 混合机
	1. Stir and mix
	2. Addition of liquid oil [[RM]]
6. 粉料罐
	1. One 粉料罐 只能储存一个formula

#### Other notes
1. During changeover of grinding the next batch of a different [[formula]], last formula will have remains in the system, estimated to be hundreds of kilograms. Therefore, either use the new batch [[formula]] to flush the system to minimize the risk of [[cross contamination]]. Oftentimes, Protein OOS from lab results are due to insufficient cleaning / remains in the system from last formula.
