#### Extrusion Process Attributes
1. Extrusion follows [[Pet Food Grinding Process|Grinding]] in the [[RSH Factory|RSH Facotry]] production process
2. Currently has 2 extrudor lines, W1 & W2 (W stands for Wenger, a brand that makes the extrudor machines)
	1. From 2021 to 2022, we are instensively studying [[RSH Line 3]]
3. Wenger control system fetches extrusion production plans
4. Extrudors continuously "extrudes" with speeds defined by each formula

#### Extrusion Process
1. **调制机**
	1. Stir, add water, add steam
		1. A process to pre-heat and break down [[Raw Material|RM]] physically 
2. **Extrudor/Wenger** **膨化机/挤出机**
	1. **Kibble Formation**. 60+ Die Plates for different [[Pet Food Kibbles|kibbles]] (sizes and shapes)
		1. The moistured powders are heated in the extrudor, and comes out in strips after extrusion. Die plastes are used for shapes, the knives speed will determine the thickness of kibbles that comes out of the strips.
	2. **Extrusion Science**. As soon as they were extruded out of the machine, the relatively cooler room temperature and lower air pressure puff the powder and voila - BC Kibble (Before-Coating) 
	3. **Wet Waste**, a type of [[Non Quality Cost|NQC]]. The first 100-200 kg of BC kibbles will not go to the next process, as they are often not in good shape or [[Pet Food Quality|quality]]. It takes some time for the extruded product to be of good quality and shape. Experienced operators are able to control the wet waste to level as low as possible. Wet waste goes to [[Kibble Rework]].
	4. **Moisture**. The level of moisture of BC kibbles are averaged 26%
	5. **BC Kibble Test**. Lab test to evaluate different parameters of kibbles. An important part of [[Pet Food Quality|Quality]]. Test size, shape, density, protein etc. If there are deviations, an [[Non Conformity|NC]] will be reported, which requires the shift manager to decide "GO", "ON-HOLD", "REWORK",  "WASTE", etc.
3. **Dryer 烘干机**
	1. Heating from gasoline and heated air blows to bring moisture out of kibble, to a level specified below
	2. Moisture Standards - Requirement of [[Pet Food Quality]]
		1. Dog Products: 8.0, or 9.5
		2. Cat Products: 5.5 
4. **Coating 涂汁机**
	1. Scale weighing
	2. **Coating - two types** of coating methods. Oftentimes, kibbles that require high level of liquid coating will use this so that the kibbles do not appear to be oily
		1. **Vaccum** - creates negative air pressure for kibbles to absord liquids to inside. This method is applied to 鸡油、牛油、风味剂、微量元素粉末. 
		2. **Normal Pressure** - liquides are sprayed on the kibble surface  
5. **Cooling 冷却机**
	1. A [[Critical Control Point|CCP]] point (temperature) to ensure kibble temperature is +- 10℃ around room temperature to avoid moisture and molding
6. **Test 检测**
	1. If passed, then goes to FG Silo
	2. If not passed, then goes to 7002 FG Silo as rework
