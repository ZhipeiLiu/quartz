### Points
#### Scales

#### Temperature
- Ensure that kibbles out of extrudors have temperature similar to the room temperature of packing area, within +- 10℃ difference, to avoid moisture, which is a source of molds
#### Metal Detector
- HACCP points in [[Pet Food Packaging Process|Packaging]] to kick out bags if metal is detected. This requires a recheck of effectiveness every 4 hours due to [[Pet Food Quality]] requirement.
