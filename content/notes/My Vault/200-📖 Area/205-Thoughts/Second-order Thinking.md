## Second-order thinking

Consider the long-term consequences of your decisions.

Some decisions seem like wins at first, but turn out to be losses over time. What seems like an investment now turns out to be a liability later. What looked like a good decision earlier is now a bad one. Second-order thinking is a tool that will help you examine the long-term effects of your decisions.

Most people stop at first-order thinking. Second-order thinking is necessary to make decisions that will stand the test of time. We need to make sure we're okay with more long-term consequences of our decisions today.

## How to use it?

Using second-order thinking can be a purely mental exercise or you can write it down on paper.

Consider a decision you have to make. Start by looking at **the most immediate effects of making this decision – the first order**.

Then for each of the effect ask yourself: "**And then what?"** That's how you examine the second order of this decision's consequences. You can repeat this for as many orders as you find practical.

Alternatively, **think about the decision in different timelines**. Ask yourself: What will be the consequences of this decision in

-   10 minutes? 
-   10 months?
-   10 years?

This way you can think about the short-term, medium-term and long-term consequences of your decision.

You can apply second-order thinking on big decisions (e.g. buying a house), but also small, seemingly mundane, decisions (e.g. eating a cake). It's a very universal tool that is relevant not just in personal life, but also in business or policy-making.

## Second-order thinking in practice

Let's explore what second-order thinking looks like in action. Consider the decision of buying a house outside of the city.

The immediate effects might be having a garden, more space for your family, but also suddenly living an hour away from work.

Now look at higher-order consequences of each:

-   having a garden → able to grow your produce → having fresh herbs and vegetables
-   more space for family → more rooms to clean → more stress from a messy home 
-   living an hour away from work → need to buy a car → spending two hours of each day in a car

Obviously, this is just a small subset of consequences for such a big decision, but it shows how second-order thinking can help you see the more long-term consequences. You can now make a more informed and thoughtful decision.
