1. ==Calculating Liquidity Ratios== [LO2] SDJ, Inc., has net working capital of $2,170, current liabilities of $4,590, and inventory of $3,860. What is the current ratio? What is the quick ratio?
	- NWC = CA - CL --> CA = 6760
	- Current ratio = CA/CL = 1.4727668845
	- Quick ratio = (CA-Inv)/CL = 0.6318082789

2. ==Calculating Profitability Ratios== [LO2] DTO, Inc., has sales of $16.7 million, total assets of $12.9 million, and total debt of $5.7 million. If the profit margin is 5 percent, what is net income? What is ROA? What is ROE?
	- NI = 16.7 * 5% = 0.835
	- ROA = NI/A = 0.835/12.9 = 0.06472868217
	- ROE = ROA * A/E = 0.06472868217*12.9/5.7 = 0.1464912281

3. ==Calculating the Average Collection Period== [LO2] Twist Corp. has a current accounts receivable balance of $537,810. Credit sales for the year just ended were $5,473,640. What is the receivables turnover? The days’ sales in receivables? How long did it take on average for credit customers to pay off their accounts during the past year?
	- Known: AR, Credit sales, 
	- AR T.O = 5473640/537810 = 10.1776463807
	- Days' sales in R = 365/10.1776463807 = 35.8629084119
	- A bit over a month, on average



### 真题。。。
1. ==DuPont Identity== If Wilkinson, Inc., has an equity multiplier of 1.35, total asset turnover of 2.10, and a profit margin of 5.2 percent, what is its ROE?
