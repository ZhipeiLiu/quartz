- ==M&A Framework==
	- XXX | Customers | Products | Company (in-company strength) | Competition
	-------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
	Company A | 
	Company B | 
	Combined Entity | 

- Synergy Example
	- Different advantages are combined
		- Younger company has the newest technology and product
		- Older company has the distribution power, sales ability
	- Cost Overlap

####  O&O - Global ad brand agency 
- profit is flat (0%)
	- no change in cost
	- no change in revenue
		- Rev per Accounts - flat
		- \# of Accounts - flat
- needs growth

Area | Industry | O&O
------- | -------- | --------
Profits | 5% | 0

### Competition
Ask: 
- Who are the major categories of competitors? - goes into Competitors
	- What does each do?

- What is the concentration of the market share
	- Competition | Market Share | Growth Rate of Profits
		-------- | -------- | --------
		1. Global Ad Agency;  | 50% | -1%
		2. Direct Response Media Agency;  | 10% | 0
		3. Digital Advertising;  | 20% | ==30%==
		4. Media Buying | 20% | 0

Say:
- Interesting. It looks like customers are really driving the increase in digital ad growth
- I am gonna switch gears and look into ==customers segment==

### Customers
Ask: 
- What are their segments?
- Growth rates for each segment?
	- Customers | Share of Spending | Change in Spending
	-------- | -------- | --------
	F500 Brand Managers | 70% | 0%
	Mid-market | 20% | 0%
	SMB | 10% | 0%
- ask for absolute numbers
###### When in doubt, Segment it!!! - golden rule
- Say: 
	- Clearly I am not sure what is going on here, but something's very odd. How can you have a competitor category who is going up 30% per year, when the overall market is flat? The big companies seem to be fairly flat. I am puzzled. I want to segment (then shut up)
- Total Ad Spend | $4M in total | steady over the past 3 years
	-------- | -------- | --------
	F500 Brand Divisions | $3B | shrinking 
	F500 Interactive | $1B | up
	
Say:
- From an industry standpoint, the companies that are doing the best are the ones that are offering digital ad services - the only fast-growing segment
- If looking at the customer/demand side, the overall spending has been flat - there has been a rapid shift from traditional ad to digital ad

- What does each customer segment want?
- O&O 
	- what is their mix of business?
	- what percentage of media is through the various media types?
- Then find out if O&O focused too much on areas that customers do not care

- Check pricing - traditional media ad agency get lower commission than digital ad (less profitable)

Ask:
- What is driving the trend from traditional to digital?
	- don't assume
	- a **structural shift** driven by viewers - flowing through advertisers who want to be where the people are - impacting the profitability of the agencies that are serving these advertisers 

==Conclusion==:
- The market has turned into favor of an area O&O does not have expertise in, then how does O&O respond?

### What would you recommend to O&O?
- need to figure out what asset the company has to determine what they can do

- OO Capabilities and Expertise
	- create blockbuster television ads
	- good at being creative
	- distribution channel - great sales force in good contact with F500 managers
- Customers are in need of number-based advertisement
	- OO is not positioned properly in the marketplace to catch demands
		- the segment OO is strong in is shrinking
		- the segment OO is poor in is growing incredibly fast

Suggestions:
- they gotta be at where the demand is 
	- build that capability internally OR
	- you buy ( if OO does not have capabilities that customers want )

Say:
- Given that there is not just a skills mismatch between what OO is good at and what customers want 
- there is a cultural issue too - the way OO people think about ad is different than the numeric-driven marketers that are interested in digital ad
- The best option seems to be acquisition because the ability to build it is too big of a leap - I will be interested into looking at acquisition options - if there are any targets that worth considering

The question becomes - "Which company should OO acquire?"

Sub-segment it - key competitor analysis
- Digital Ad Segment | Market share (1B) | Growth
	-------- | -------- | --------
	e-Cool | ==400 M== | ==fast growth==
	Super-click | 200 M | normal growth
	Math-Ads | 200 M | normal growth
	Others | 200 M | normal growth
	
	## M&A framework
	- XXX | Customers | Products | Company | Competition
	-------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | 
	O&O | F500 Brand Accounts | TV Ads; Focus groups; brands concepts | Best brand-building | similar
	eCool | F500 e Accounts | day-to-day marketing tools; statistical modeling; online ad buys (confirm they meet customer's needs) | good at online campaigns; statistics | similar
	Combined Entity | [Check] significant growth in accounts (few overlaps) | [Check] Pick up needed capabilities [Check] complementary | 
	
	- Cultural stuff is important for ma
	
	Say:
	- Overall, acquisition price aside, this acquisition seems to be a good fit.
	- potential **issues**: 
		- cultural fit - to tackle with it - how to organizationally minimize cultural risk
			- if culture does not fit well: keep them apart - don't share offices - independent arms
		- capacity issue
			- high fixed-cost
