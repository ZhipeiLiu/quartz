### Summary
![[five-forces.png]]
- Five Competitive Forces - helps understand the structure of an industry
	1. ==Established rivals==
	2. ==Customers== - force down prices
	3. ==Suppliers== - constrain profits
	4. ==Entrants== - have new capacity and hungry for market share - ratchet up investment required to play the game
	5. ==Substitute offerings== - lure customers away

### Companies' strategy
- Position your comapny where the forces are weakest
- Exploit changes in the forces
- **Reshape the forces in your favor** 
	- neutralize supplier power - standardize specs and make switching vendors easier
	- counter customer power - expand your services 
	- temper price wars with established rivals - invest in differentiating products
	- scare off entrants - elevate fixed cost for entering (R&D #but-why)
	- limit substitutes threat - offer better value through increasing accessibility and visibility


- forces are intense: airlines, textiles, and hotels
	- few company earns attractive returns on investment
- benign: software, soft drinks, and toiletries
	- many companies are profitable

- Threat of entry - puts a cap on profit potential

### Analysis of market entry
- ==Barriers to entry== - incumbents have
	1. supply-side economies of scale - cost advantage
		- in research, manufacturing, and marketing
		- in supply chain, media advertising
		- in national logistical systems, and IT
	2. demand-side benefits of scale - aka. Network effects
		- customers tend to flock into a few products
	3. customer switching costs
		- e.g. ERP software,
	4. capital requirements
		- up-front advertising and R&D costs more and the more the better
	5. Incumbency advantages independent of size
		- proprietary technology
		- preferential access to the best raw material sources
		- preemption of the most favorable geographic locations
		- established brand identities
		- cumulative experience that has allowed incumbents to learn how to produce more efficiently
	6. Unequal access to distribution channels
	7. Restrictive government policy
		- positive: licensing requirements, patenting rules
		- negative: subsidies, funding basic research
- ==Expected retaliation==

### Industry analysis in practice
Related: [[202006141448 Industry Research]]
- Good industry analysis looks rigorously at the structural underpinnings of profitability. A first step is to understand the appropriate time horizon. 
- The point of industry analysis is not to declare the industry attractive or unattractive but to understand the underpinnings of competition and the root causes of profitability.
- The strength of the competitiveforces affects prices, costs, and the investment required to compete; thus the forces are directly tied to the income statements and balance sheets of industry participants
- Finally, good industry analysis does not just list pluses and minuses but sees an industry in overall, systemic terms.

- Typical steps in industry analysis
	1. Define the relevant industry
		- products
		- geography
	2. Identify the participants and segment them into groups, if appropriate
		- who are buyers and buyer groups, suppliers and supplier groups, competitors, substitutes, potential entrants?
	3. Assess the underlying drivers of each competitive force to determine which forces are strong and which are weak and why
	4. Determine overall industry structure, and test the analysis for consistency
		- why profitable
		- controlling forces for profitability
		- is the industry analysis consistent with actual long-run profitability
		- the ability to position compared to more-profitable players
	5. Analyze recent and likely future changes in each force, both positive and negative
	6. Identify aspects of industry structure that might be influenced by competitors, by new entrants, or by your company.

- Common pitfalls
	- Define the industry too broadly or narrowly
	- Making lists instead of engaging in rigorous analysis. 
	- Paying equal attention to all of the forces rather than digging deeply into the most important ones. 
	- Confusing effect (price sensitivity) with cause (buyer economics). 
	- Using static analysis that ignores industry trends. 
	- Confusing cyclical or transient changes with true structural changes. 
	- Using the framework to declare an industry attractive or unattractive rather than using it to guide strategic choices.

### Power of suppliers
- more concentrated than the industry it sells to
- supplier group does not depend heavily on the industry for its revenues
- Industry participants face switching costs in changing suppliers
- Suppliers offer products that are differen- tiated
- There is no substitute for what the sup- plier group provides
- The supplier group can credibly threaten to integrate forward into the industry.

### Power of buyers
- There are few buyers
	- Large-volume buyers are particularly powerful in industries with high fixed costs, such as telecommunications equip- ment, offshore drilling, and bulk chemicals. 
- The industry’s products are standardized or undifferentiated
- few switching costs
- Buyers can credibly threaten to integrate backward and produce the industry’s product themselves if vendors are too profitable

### Price sensitivity of a buyer group
- The product it purchases from the indus- try represents a significant fraction of its cost structure or procurement budget.
- The buyer group earns low profits, is strapped for cash, or is otherwise under pres- sure to trim its purchasing costs.
- The quality of buyers’ products or services is little affected by the industry’s product. 
- The industry’s product has little effect on the buyer’s other costs.
- Intermediate customers gain significant bargaining power when they can influence the purchasing deci- sions of customers downstream. Consumer electronics retailers, jewelry retailers, and agri- cultural-equipment distributors are examples of distribution channels that exert a strong in- fluence on end customers.

### Threat of substitutes
high if:
- It offers an attractive price-performance trade-off to the industry’s product
- The buyer’s cost of switching to the substi- tute is low.

### Rivalry among existing competitors
greatest if:
- Competitors are numerous or are roughly equal in size and power.
- Industry growth is slow
- Exit barriers are high
- Rivals are highly committed to the busi- ness and have aspirations for leadership
- Firms cannot read each other’s signals well 

Price competition is most liable to occur if
- Products or services of rivals are nearly identical and there are few switching costs for buyers.
- Fixed costs are high and marginal costs are low.
- Capacity must be expanded in large incre- ments to be efficient
- The product is perishable

- Competition on dimensions other than price—on product features, support services, delivery time, or brand image, for instance—is less likely to erode profitability because it im- proves customer value and can support higher prices.
- The opportu- nity for positive-sum competition will be greater in industries serving diverse customer groups.

### Factors in addition to the five forces:
- Industry growth rate
	- fast growth can put suppliers in a powerful position, and high growth with low entry barriers will draw in entrants. 
	- customers are powerful or substitutes are at- tractive
- Technology and innovation.
	- Advanced technology or innovations are not by themselves enough to make an industry structurally attractive (or unattractive).
- Government
	- analyze how specific govern- ment policies affect the five competitive forces.
- Complementary products and services
	-  the presence of strong complements is not necessarily bad (or good) for industry profitability. Complements affect profitability through the way they influ- ence the five forces.
	-  must trace the positive or neg- ative influence of complements on all five forces to ascertain their impact on profitability. 
	-  complements can also affect the threat of substitutes. 

### Changes in Industry Structure 
- may be caused by changes in technol- ogy,  changes in customer needs, or other events
- Shifting threat of new entry
- Changing supplier or buyer power
- Shifting threat of substitution
- New bases of rivalry

### Boundaries of an industry
- scope of products or services
- geographic scope

### Implications for Strategy
- Positioning the company
- Exploiting industry change
- Defining the industry
