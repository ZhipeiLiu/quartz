#### How to open a case
1. Stall
	- Hmm... that's an interesting question
2. Verify your understanding of facts
	- Terminology and facts
		- Can I ask some background question before I get started?
3. Structure the case for analysis
	1. Identify **problem**/**situation**
	2. Match to appropriate **framework**
	3. Describe **Key Components** of framework (don't mention name of framework explicitly)
	4. **Draw** the framework on a piece of paper (this is client friendly)

#### How to analyze the case
- Definition of ANALYSIS
	- The separating of any material or abstract entity into its constituent elements (opposite to synthesis)
1. **Ask** for any info on where to start
	- e.g. Profit problem
		- Say: Do we have any information from the client indicating whether this is a revenue problem or a cost problem?
2. State a **hypothesis**
	- is it a revenue problem or a cost problem
3. **Pick** a branch of framework to start
	- has revenue changed and in what direction
4. Identify **key issues** within branch
	- Do we have any information indicating that revenue is going up, flat, or going down?
5. Ask **standard questions** to gather initial data
6. Go **Deeper** down the branch if data suggest that you could, or go **UP** a level and work a different branch
	- Revenue = Revenue per unit * # Units Sold
	- Cost = Cost per unit * # Units Sold
7. **Refine** hypothesis as you discover more insights
	- Say: that's kinda odd that profit goes down while revenue goes up

- Tips
	- Think out loud
	- Use "hypothesis" a lot
		- educated guess
		- Gather data to test validity
		- Modify hypothesis (and say you are doing so)
		- Ask for more data to test revised hypothesis
	- Critical comparison of numbers
		- Company vs. Competitors
			- Company-specific or Industry-wide problem
		- Current Year vs. Previous Year
			- Find the trend
	- Segment your numbers
	- Ask for data


#### How to close a case
- Figure out what's **important** about what you've discovered (insight)
- Provide a "big picture" **point of view** or **conclusion**
	- Ideally with recommended **action**
- **Support** your point of view with data
	- Synthesis
- Conclusion structure
	- Conclusion
		- Data 1
		- Data 2
		- Data 3
