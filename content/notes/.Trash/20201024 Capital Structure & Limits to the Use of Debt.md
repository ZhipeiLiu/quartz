### Lecture Notes
- Bankruptcy costs & Firm value
	- The tax advantages of debt are offset by bankruptcy costs
		- Leverage --> Increased risk of bankruptcy
		- Bankruptcy --> Bankruptcy costs --> Reduced cash flows to investors
			- It is the cost of bankruptcy (and not the bankruptcy itself) that destroys firm value
- Costs of financial distress
	- **Direct Costs** of Financial Distress
		- Lawyer fees
		- Administrative & accounting fees
		- Expert witnesses
	- **Indirect Costs** of Financial Distress
		- Impaired ability to conduct business
		- Damaged relationships with customers & suppliers
	- **Agency Costs** of Debt
		- Reduced firm value due to conflicts of interest between stockholders and bondholders
			- Selfish Investment Strategy 1: Incentive to Take Large Risks
				- Stockholders prefer high-risk projects in order to expropriate value from bondholders 
			- Selfish Investment Strategy 2: Incentive toward Underinvestment
				- Stockholders prefer not to finance new investments that benefit the bondholders at the stockholders’ expense
			- Selfish Investment Strategy 3: Milking the Property
				- Stockholders prefer to receive extra dividends in times of financial distress
- Reducing financial distress costs
	- Protective Covenants
		- Designed to limit or require certain actions by a company during the term of the loan to protect the lender’s interest
		- Negative Covenants 
			- Dividend limitations
			- Collateral restrictions
			- Asset sale & lease limitations
			- Merger restrictions
			- Long-term debt issuance restrictions
		- Positive Covenants
			- Working capital requirements
			- Periodic financial statements
	- Protective covenants --> Reduced financial distress costs --> Increased value of firm
		- Alternative strategies for reducing financial distress costs are inferior
			- Issue no debt
			- Issue debt with no protective covenants
	- Additional Techniques to Reduce Financial Distress Costs
		- Consolidate debt
		- Encourage bondholders to purchase stock
- Static Trade-off theory
	- Static Trade-Off Theory of Capital Structure
		- Capital structure decisions involve a trade-off between the tax benefits of debt and the costs of financial distress
	- Optimal Amount of Debt (B*) 
		- Causes the marginal tax benefit of debt to offset the marginal cost of financial distress 
		- Maximizes firm value
		- Minimizes WACC

- The Pie Model
	- According to the pie model, the total value of the firm consists of 4 components
		- $V_T = S+B+G+L = VV_M+V_N$
		- where 
		- S = market value of equity
		- B = market value of debt
		- G = value of government claims (taxes)
		- L = value of bankruptcy claims (lawyers)
		- $V_M$ = value of marketable claims
		- $V_N$ = value of nonmarketable claims
	- Implications of the Pie Model
		- Capital structure does not affect the overall size of the pie, or total value ($V_T$)
			- However, it does impact how the pie is sliced
			- An increase in $V_M$ necessitates an identical decrease in $V_N$
		- Rational managers should choose a capital structure that maximizes $V_M$
			- This component represents firm value
- Debt signaling theory
	- Valuable firms should issue more debt than less valuable firms
		- Higher expected profits --> Higher optimal debt levels
	- Investors view debt as a signal of firm value
		- Increase in debt --> Increase in stock price
	- Firms can “fool” the market by raising debt above the optimal level
		- Initial rise in stock price should eventually be followed by decline of greater magnitude
		- More valuable firms are more capable of debt signaling
- Agency Costs of equity
	- Agency costs of equity arise due to the conflicting interests of shareholders and management
		- Shirking
		- Perquisites
		- Unprofitable Investments
	- Static Trade-Off Model with Agency Costs of Equity
		- $\Delta$ in firm value from replacing equity with debt = (1) + (2) – (3)
			- Tax shield on debt
			- Reduction in agency costs of equity
			- Increase in costs of financial distress
	- Free Cash Flow Hypothesis
		- Reductions in free cash flows limit the opportunity for managers to waste corporate resources
			- Dividends
			- Principal and interest
		- A shift from equity to debt will boost firm value
- Pecking-order theory
	- Pure Pecking-Order Theory
		- Virtually all firms should issue debt instead of equity
			- Relies on information asymmetry and timing motives
			- Investors interpret equity issuance as a signal of overvaluation that triggers a stock price decline
				- Equity is undervalued --> issue debt
				- Equity is slightly or moderately overvalued --> issue debt
				- Equity is severely overvalued --> issue equity
	- Rules of the Pecking-Order Theory
		- Use internal financing
		- Issue safe securities first
	- Several implications of the pecking-order theory contradict the static trade-off theory
		- There is no target amount of leverage
		- Profitable firms use less debt
		- Companies like financial slack
- Personal taxes & capital structure
	- Capital structure decisions should incorporate the effects of both corporate and personal taxes
		- Optimal capital structure will yield the greatest cash flows for investors
			- If dividends and interest are taxed at the same personal rate and there are no costs of financial distress, then firms should only issue debt
				- Cash Flow to Stockholders = $(1 – T_C) * (1 – T_I)$
				- Cash Flow to Bondholders = $(1 – T_I)$
		- The firm will be indifferent between debt and equity when the cash flows to stockholders and bondholders are equal
			- $(1 – T_C) * (1 – T_S) = 1 – T_B$
- How firms establish capital structure
	- Empirical Findings on Capital Structure in Practice
		1. Most nonfinancial corporations have low debt-asset ratios
		2. A number of firms use no debt
		3. Capital structure trends vary by industry
		4. Most corporations employ target debt-equity ratios
			- Determinants of target ratios:
				- Taxes
				- Types of investments
				- Uncertainty of operating income
		5. Capital structures of individual firms can vary significantly over time
