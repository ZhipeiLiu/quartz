# [[202006141414 Zettelkasten Principles|Zettelkasten Principles]]


1. Atomicity. Each note should contain one idea only
2. Autonomy. Each note should be autonomous, meaning it should be self-contained and comprehensible on its own.[This allows notes to be moved, processed, separated, and concatenated independently of its neighbors](https://omxi.se/2015-06-21-living-with-a-zettelkasten.html).
3. Always link your notes. Avoid notes that are disconnected from other notes. A note that is not connected to the network will be lost, will be forgotten by the Zettelkasten” ([original in German](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/soz/luhmann-archiv/pdf/jschmidt_zettelkasten-als-uberraschungsgenerator.pdf)).
4. [**Explain why you’re linking notes**](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-antifragile/). Otherwise, years down the road when you revisit your notes, you may have no idea why you connected them.
5. Use your own words.
6. Keep references. ❌ plagiarism & revisit the original source later on.
7. Add your own thoughts to the Zettelkasten, while keeping in mind the principle of atomicity, autonomy, and the need for linking.
8. Don’t worry about structure. No folder structure.
9. Add connection notes, specific notes whose purpose is to link together other notes and explain their relationship.
10. Add outline notes. As ideas begin to coalesce into themes, create outline notes. An outline note is a note that simply contains a sequence of links to other notes, [putting those other notes into a particular order to create a story, narrative, or argument](https://omxi.se/2015-06-21-living-with-a-zettelkasten.html).
11. Never delete. Don’t delete old notes. Instead, link to new notes that explain what’s wrong with the old ones. In that way,[your Zettelkasten will reflect how your thinking has evolved over time](https://sociologica.unibo.it/article/view/8350/8270), which will prevent [hindsight bias](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias). Moreover, if you don’t delete, you might revisit old ideas that may turn out to be correct after all.
12. Add notes without fear. But [adding more notes will never break your Zettelkasten or interfere with its proper operation](https://omxi.se/2015-06-21-living-with-a-zettelkasten.html). Remember, Luhmann had 90,000 notes in his Zettelkasten!
