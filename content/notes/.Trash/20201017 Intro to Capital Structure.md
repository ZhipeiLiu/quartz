#### Learning Objectives
1. Summarize the effect of financial leverage on firm value and the required return
2. Describe the Modigliani & Miller propositions both with and without corporate taxes
3. Solve for the break-even EBIT that causes two different capital structures to yield the same earnings per share
4. Calculate the value of equity as well as the value of the firm under various capital structures
5. Compute the cost of equity as well as the weighted average cost of capital under various capital structures

#### Guiding Questions
1. Why should stockholders be concerned about the value of the entire firm?
2. How do taxes affect the implications of the Modigliani & Miller Propositions?
3. According to Modigliani & Miller, what would be the ideal capital structure in a world with corporate taxes but no bankruptcy costs?

## Lecture Notes
### Capital Structure
- The mix of the various debt and equity capital maintained by a firm
- Should be designed to maximize the value of the firm
	- V = B + S
	- V = value of firm
	- B = market value of debt
	- S = market value of equity
- The pie model considers how the total pie should be sliced in order to render the total pie as large as possible
- Why should the stockholders in the firm care about maximizing the value of the entire firm, as opposed to only the value of equity?
- If use debt to issue dividend, Equity value declines for 2 reasons
	1. The cash dividend represents a partial liquidation
	2. Debt creates a financial burden 

### Financial Leverage and Firm Value
- Optimal capital structure 
- ==Modigliani & Miller Proposition I (No Taxes)==
	- The value of the levered firm is the same as the value of the unlevered firm
	- $V_L = V_U$
	- This is because when levered firms are priced too high, rational investors will borrow funds to invest in unlevered firms
		- This homemade leverage duplicates the effects of corporate leverage 
		- However, individuals must be able to borrow at the corporate borrowing rate
- ==Modigliani & Miller Proposition II (No Taxes)==
	- The required return on equity is positively related to leverage
		- $R_S=R_0+\frac{B}{S}(R_0-R_B)$
		- where $R_0$ is the cost of capital for an all-equity firm
		- This is because the risk to equity holders increases with leverage
- Summary of MM Results
	- Both the **value of the firm** and the **firm’s overall cost of capital** are invariant to leverage
		- The lower cost of debt is offset by a rise in the cost of equity
- Managers should feel indifferent about capital structure decisions
	- In reality, typical leverage varies by industry
	- This discrepancy may reflect violations of underlying assumptions
		- Borrowing rate is the same for individuals and corporations 
		- No taxes
		- No bankruptcy costs or other agency costs
- The Tax Benefits of Debt
	- Leverage creates a tax shield
		- The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017 limits the net interest deduction
	- Assuming the same pie, the levered firm will have lower taxes and greater firm value than the all-equity firm
	- Leverage increases the value of the firm by the PV of the tax shield
- ==Modigliani & Miller Proposition I with Corporate Taxes==
	- The value of the levered firm exceeds the value of the unlevered firm by the PV of the tax shield
		- Assumes a firm has perpetual debt
			- $V_L=V_U+T_CB$
			- Where 
			- $V_L$ = PV of levered firm
			- $V_U$ = PV of unlevered firm
			- $T_CB$ = PV of tax shield
	- Calculating the Present Value of the Tax Shield
		- Assumptions:
		- $R_B$ = Interest rate
		- B = Amount borrowed
		- $T_C$ = Corporate tax rate
		- The debt is perpetual
		- The tax shield cash flows are as risky as the interest on the debt
		- $Interest = R_B \times B$
		- $Tax\ shield\ from\ debt = T_C \times (R_B \times B)$
		- $PV\ of\ tax\ shield = \frac{T_CR_BB}{R_B} = T_CB$
- Calculating the Value of the Levered Firm
	- Step 1: Compute the value of the unlevered firm, where
		- $V_U$ = PV of unlevered firm
		- EBIT x (1 – $T_C$) = after-tax cash flow of unlevered firm
		- $T_C$ = Corporate tax rate
		- $R_0$ = Cost of capital for unlevered firm
		- $V_U = \frac{EBIT \times (1-T_C)}{R_0}$
	- Step 2: Add the PV of the tax shield to compute the value of the levered firm
		- $𝑉_𝐿= \frac{𝐸𝐵𝐼𝑇 𝑥 (1 − 𝑇_𝐶)}{𝑅_0} + \frac{𝑇_𝐶 𝑅_𝐵 𝐵}{𝑅_𝐵} =𝑉_𝑈+𝑇_𝐶 𝐵$
		- The firm can raise its total cash flow and its value by substituting debt for equity
- ==Modigliani & Miller Proposition II with Corporate Taxes==
	- The required return on equity is positively related to leverage
	- $𝑅_𝑆=𝑅_0+\frac{𝐵}{𝑆} \times (1 − 𝑇_𝐶 )\times (𝑅_0−𝑅_𝐵)$
	- where $R_0$ is the cost of capital for an all-equity firm
- The Effect of Leverage on Stock Price Under Corporate Taxes
	- An increase in the value of the firm from debt financing causes an increase in the price of the stock
