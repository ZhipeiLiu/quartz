## Summary
- Operational effectiveness
- Productivity frontier - 内卷 - relative improvement for no one
- Competitive convergence
- Strategic positioning

Ideas in Practice:
1. Strategy is the creation of a unique and valuable position, involving a different set of activities
	- serving few needs of many customers
	- serving broad needs of few customers
	- serving broad needs of many customers in a narrow market
2. Strategy requires you to make trade-offs in competing - to choose what *not* to do
	- gains in one area can be achieved only at the expense of another area
3. Strategy involves creating "fit" among a company's activities
	- Fit drives both competitive advantage and sustainability: when activities mutually reinforce each other, competitors have a hard time emulating them



## What is Strategy?

### Operational Effectiveness is NOT Strategy
- [Dangerous half-truths] Positioning is rejected as too static for today's dynamic markets and changing technologies. Rivals can quickly copy any market position and competitive advantage is at best, temporary.
	- The root of the problem is the failure to distinguish between **operational effectiveness** and **strategy**.
	- productivity tools and techniques:
		- Total Quality Management (TQM)
		- Benchmarking
		- Time-based competition
		- Outsourcing
		- Partnering
		- Reengineering
		- Change management
	- Operational Effectiveness: Necessary but not sufficient. 
	- A company can outperform rivals only if it can establish a difference that it can preserve
		- deliver greater value to customers
		- create comparable value at a lower cost
		- or both
	- Delivering greater value allows a company to charge higher average unit prices
	- greater efficiency results in lower average unit costs
	- Cost is generated by performing activities, and cost advantage arises from performing particular activities more efficiently than competitors. 
	- Similarly, differentiation arises from both the choice of activities and how they are performed. 
	- Activities, then are the basic units of competitive advantage
	- ==Operational effectiveness== (OE) means performing similar activities *better* than rivals perform them.
	- ==Strategic positioning== means performing *different* activities from rivals' or performing similar activities in *different* ways
	- When a company improves its operational effectiveness, it moves toward the frontier. Doing so may require capital investment, different personal, or simply new ways of managing. 
	- The productivity frontier is constantly shifting outward as new technologies and management approaches are developed and as new inputs become available. 
	- As companies move to the frontier, they can often improve on multiple dimensions of performance at the same time.
	- Constant improvement in operational effectiveness is necessary to achieve superior profitability.
	- Competitors can quickly imitate management techniques, new technologies, input improvements, and superior ways of meeting customers' needs. 
	- OE competition shifts the productivity frontier outward, effectively raising the bar for everyone --> lead to profitability captured by consumers
	- The second reason that improved operational effectiveness is insufficient - competitive convergence - is more subtle and insidious

### Strategy Rests on Unique Activities
- Japanese Companies Rarely Have Strategies
	- speak for 1970s and 1980s
	- they have operational effectiveness
- The Origins of Strategic Positions
	1. Positioning can be based on producing a subset of an industry's products or services - AKA variety-based positioning
		- A variety-based positioning can serve a wide array of customers, but for most it will meet only a subset of their needs
	2. Serving most or all the needs of a particular group of customers - AKA. needs-based positioning
	3. Segmenting customers who are accessible in different ways - AKA. access-based positioning
		- Access can be a function of customer geography or customer scale
### A Sustainable Strategic Position Requires Trade-offs
- a competitor can reposition itself to match the superior performer
- a strategic position is not sustainable unless there are trade-offs with other positions
	- Trade-offs arise for three reasons:
		1. Inconsistencies in image or reputation
		2. trade-offs arise from activities themselves
		3. trade-offs arise from limits on internal coordination and control
### Fit Drives Both Competitive Advantage and Sustainability
- While operational effectiveness is about achieving excellence in individual activities, or functions, strategy is about *combining* activities
- Fit locks out imitators by creating a chain that is as strong as its strongest link
- Three types of fit
	- *simple consistency* between each activity (function) and the overall strategy
	- *activities are reinforcing*
	- *optimization of effort*
- Coordination and information exchange across activities to eliminate redundancy and minimize wasted effort are the most basic types of effort optimization
- Fit and sustainability
	- Strategic fit among many activities is fundamental not only to competitive advantage but also to the sustainability of that advantage
	- Positions built on systems of activities are far more sustainable than those built on individual activities
- The more a company's positioning rests on activity systems with second- and third-order fit, the more sustainable its advantage will be
- Fit among a company's activities creates pressures and incentives to improve operational effectiveness, which makes imitation even harder
- Continuity of strategic position fosters improvements in individual activities and the fit across activities, thus build unique capabilities and skills tailored to its strategy as well as to reinforces a company's identity
- Frequent shifts in positioning are costly

### Rediscovering Strategy
- The Failure to Choose
- The Growth Trap
	- Reconnecting with Strategy requires looking back
- Profitable Growth
	- Companies seeking growth through broadening within their industry can best contain the risks to strategy by creating stand-alone units, each with its own brand name and tailored activities
- The Role of Leadership
	- Strategy requires constant discipline and clear communication

#### Alternative Views of Strategy
The Implicit Strategy Model of the Past Decade | Sustainable Competitive Advantage
-------- | --------
One idea competitive position in the industry | Unique competitive position for the company
Benchmarking of all activities and achieving best practice | Activities tailored to strategy
Aggressive outsourcing and partnering to gain efficiencies | Clear trade-offs and choices vis-à-vis competitors
Advantages rest on a few key success factors, critical resources, core competencies | Competitive advantage arises from fit across activities
Flexibility and rapid responses to all competitive and market changes | Sustainability comes from the activity system, not the parts
_ | Operational effectiveness a given
