Assumes: US forecasters would agree with each other more
Reality: US forecasters highly disagree with each other, higher than how foreign forecaster disagree

Why HQ-based?
- Regulatory: non-US forecaster companies do not have exposure to US regulatiomns

What about USA-registered foreign-originated companies?
- As logn as they get exposure to US services and US GDP, then they are USA
