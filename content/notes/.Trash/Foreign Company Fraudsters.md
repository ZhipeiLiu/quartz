# [[Foreign Company Fraudsters]]
### Approach to suspect instances of frauds
- NMC
	- issue: tremendous debt unreported
	- 2.1B USD of debt reported - 6.6 identified
	- "Too good to be true aspect" - something that drew MW in the first place
		- profit margin >>>> comps (red flag)
		- highly acquisitive and/of raising a lot of debt (external funding) (orange flag)
- Luckin
	- peripheral role in Luckin fraud
	- MW received report in 2020/1, MW did due diligence later and confirmed; not MW research after all
	- report is from someone they know for years
	- foreign companies costs more to investgate compared to a home issuer (language and translation, lawyers dont understand the law framework)
- GSX
	- More involved with investigating GSX
- EM fraudulent companies
	- Weak rule of law locally - far from US/UK law
	- companies established in developed countries got ripped off in EM countries (china)


NASDAQ itself is publicly traded - they have the motivation to protect its members (they want listing fees & trading commisions but dont want to act as regulators)
Companies are here in the US, not to be friends, but to make money for themselves

EM markets:
no established social contract of assuming people always telling the truth
