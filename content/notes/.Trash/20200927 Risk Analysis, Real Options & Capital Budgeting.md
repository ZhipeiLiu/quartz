- NPV analysis can lead a firm to accept a project that ultimately fails
- One way to limit this problem is to conduct sensitivity analysis
	- Examines the sensitivity of NPV to changes in underlying assumptions
		- Standard approach calls for changes to only one input at a time 
	- AKA what-if analysis or bop (best, optimistic, & pessimistic) analysis
	- Drawbacks
		- exacerbate a false sense of security among managers
		- Treating variables in isolation may be unrealistic
- One solution is to instead conduct scenario analysis
	- A variant of sensitivity analysis that examines the sensitivity of NPV to simultaneous changes in **multiple** underlying assumptions
- An alternative method of examining variability in forecasts is break-even analysis
	- Determines the quantity of sales necessary for the project to earn zero profit
	- There are two variations:
		1. Accounting profit break-even
			- Quantity of sales necessary for accounting profit to equal 0
			- $Units \times (Price - VC) = Fixed\ costs + Depreciation$
			- $\# \ of\ units = \frac{Fixed\ costs + Depreciation}{Sales\ price - Variable\ costs\ per\ unit}$
			- difference between sales price and variable costs per unit is the *pre-tax contribution margin*
			- 
		2. Financial break-even
			- Quantity of sales necessary for net present value of operating cash flows to equal 0
			- $\frac{EAC + Fixed\ costs \times (1-T_c) - Depreciation \times T_c}{(Sales\ price - Variable\ costs\ per\ unit) \times (1-T_c)}$
			where
			- $EAC = \frac{Initial\ investment}{PVIFA_{r,t}}$
- Capital budgeting investment rules are criticized for ignoring potential adjustments after a project is accepted
	- The option to expand
	- The option to abandon
	- Timing options
- These adjustments are called real options
	- Options to perform an action in managing a business or as part of a project
	- Should be considered in project valuation since corporations make decisions in a dynamic environment
		- Otherwise, traditional NPV analysis will likely underestimate the true value of a project
- The Option to Expand
	- Offers value if demand exceeds expectations
- The Option to Abandon
	- Offers value if demand falls short of expectations
- Timing Options
	- Offers value if the underlying variables change with a favorable trend
- An individual project can be viewed as a series of real options
	- Decision trees aid in simultaneously evaluating these sequential options when making capital budgeting decisions
		- One must work backward and consider the various decisions in reverse order
